this might mean abandoning methods centered on including people in dominant paradigms to foreground exploding the traditional topoi in favor of a heterotopic, messy, and multipled conception of “DH.”

Professionalism is environmental. Amateurism is anti-environmental. Professionalism merges the individual into patterns of total environment. Amateurism seeks the development of total awareness of the individual and the critical awareness of the groundrules of society. The amateur can afford to lose. The professional tends to classify and specialize, to accept uncritically the groundrules of the environment. The groundrules provided by the mass response of his colleagues serve as a pervasive environment of which he is contentedly and [sic] unaware. The “expert” is the man who stays put. (McLuhan and Fiore, 93)

Lorde has stated that “the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house,” framing the question of tools through a metaphor to slave rebellions in a way that would discourage scholars from using tools created by oppressive systems

As opposed to the staid, “backward-looking” humanities we are used to, the digital humanities “experiments,” “plays,” and even “embraces failure” on ideological grounds. In short, we are the hero Gotham needs.

A Fabulously Messy Business,” Alyson Campbell and Stephen Farrier identify the messiness of queerness as a methodology, one in which “messiness is imbricated with queerness and where cleanliness in knowledge production is associated with knowledge forms that have routinely occluded the queer and the non-normative in an effort to tidy up hypotheses and conform to hegemonic forms of ‘rigour’”

This reading simultaneously situates digital humanities practitioners as responsible parties—designers and builders implicated in the design of future systems—and complicates that role of agency by suggesting that the ideological entailments of such systems may not be visible to their builders, and indeed that the design logics that feel most deeply natural and functional to one generation may be revealed as deeply problematic in the next.

In this work, as in McPherson’s, we can see a foundational assumption: there is no such thing as a “merely technical” design decision: technical systems are meaning systems and ideological systems, as far down as we are willing to look.

But we might also say that Hopper’s and Sammet’s work situates program code in a work ecology that is corporate and military rather than scientific: in other words, environments where technical work needs to be consumed and evaluated within systems of hierarchical power where technical expertise exists only in a limited stratum, rather than within an intellectual peer group.
