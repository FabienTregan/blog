Following link:../babis-you-1/[the first part], we'll work on solving the first level.

The first level has a feature that will simplify things:
the rules can't be changed.

This means that fixed rules can be enough to solve this level, and that the changing rules thingie can be dealt with later.

== First the plumbing

Before dealing with the solving logic, some plumbing is required to establish the game loop.

Most of the code shown here is ported from my previous link:https://github.com/archiloque/rgbexpress[efforts].

First the `Level` class will contain data related to a game level, at first only the information we found in the level, then -- by experience -- we'll add other data that will make the calculations simpler / faster.
