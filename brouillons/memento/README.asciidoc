Each time I'm deleting some code I'm thinking about the time and effort that was spent writing it.

Even if with modern tools and techniques, code is easier and faster to write, each line removed represent some effort.

And this effort is now no more.

I wanted a kind of link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori[memento mori], a shrine to remember the code that is now removed.

Here it is:

This simple script work on a git repository: it will fetch a randomly deleted line and will display it as a sober page.

To run is the syntax is

[source,bash]
----
PATH_TO_GIT_REPO='path/to/your/git/dir' memento.ru
----

It requires ruby and link:https://rack.github.io[Rack].

Then open your browser at `http://localhost:9292`

Code is a single file, under MIT license, so have fun with it.

[source,ruby]
.memento.ru
----
include::memento.ru[]
