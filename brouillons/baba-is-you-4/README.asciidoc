where I solved the first level, I'll improve the code to make it more realistic.

== Wait, what?

I said I solved the first level, at least it's what the computer told me:

[source]
----
include::log3.txt[]
----

But it would be nice if the code told me _how_ it solved it, it would allow me to check if the solution is solved, and it would allow me to use the solution to solve the level.

Which is the goal of the whole thing.
