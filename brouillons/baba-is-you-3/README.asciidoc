Following link:../babis-you-2/[the second part], we'll deal with the logic to find a solution to the first level.

The first level has a feature that will things much simpler:
the rules can't be changed.

This means that fixed rules can be enough to solve this level,
and that the changing rules features can be dealt with later.

== First the algo

Each turn we consider a game state, from it there is _at most_ four possible moves: going up, down, right or left.

At most because some direction can be blocked, things can kill you (not in the first level), or you can alter a rule and stop to control anything (not in the first level either).

If you can go in a direction, you may reach a winning state, in this case we stop the solving.

If you don't solve the level, you can add this new state to the list, and go on with the main loop.

There's a catch: Baba is not a "`burning bridge`" game where you can't move back.
Before checking if a new state is interesting, it must be vetted against the previously met cases to avoid doing the same thing again and again.

== Then some code

First thing is to detect if a move is possible.

In the further levels of the game, "`you`" can be several items, but in the first level you only control Baba, so first let's find Baba.

So being possible to go in a direction means only testing if Baba can go in this direction.

First I check if Baba can physically go in this direction from the level point of view:

.State.java
[source,java]
----
include::state2.java[]
----

And testing it:

.StateAvailableMovementsTest.java
[source,java]
----
include::stateavailablemovementstest1.java[]
----

Then we must deal with the content.
The behavior depends of the content of the position we want to move to.
The code must do three things: test if the movement is valid, test if the new position is a winning one, and calculate the new board position.

It would be possible to write each step in separate pass but I find it easier to do it in one time because all three steps depends mostly of the kind of elements on the target tile.

Calculating a new board position is done by cloning the existing one and updating the values that need to be updated.

Pushing a rock is more complex case than the others, so I'll ignore it first:

.State.java
[source,java]
----
include::state3.java[]
----

And testing it:

.StateTryToGoTest.java
[source,java]
----
include::statetrytogotest1.java[]
----

== _A_ solution

The title of this article is "`finding _a_ solution`", because we'll first write the code to find a valid solution, with a simplified algo that don't cover all possible cases, then we'll update it to make it compliant with the game rules.

I'll do it this way because the update will add complexity to the behaviors, and I prefer to first reach a state where we solved something.
