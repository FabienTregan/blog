Some programming languages languish due to obscurity. They lack breathless blog posts exclaiming how much nicer they are to use.

Other languages are too ambitious. They aspire to support so many features that the original implementers struggle to get a first version working. For example, the type system in Fortress link:https://youtu.be/EZD3Scuv02g?t=50m10s[required constraint solving which took exponential time].

Sometimes a usable language struggles simply because _itâ€™s too much fun to write your own_. Developers end up building their own implementation rather than actually using the language.

The most obvious implementation-focused language is link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck[BF]. Despite having link:https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck_implementations[many implementations], BF programmers have to link:http://www.hevanet.com/cristofd/brainfuck/epistle.html[encourage the implementers to actually try using the language]!
