I personally don't envy the life of a data platform engineer. They need to consume data from teams who have no incentive in providing meaningful, truthful and correct data. They have very little understanding of the source domains that generate the data and lack the domain expertise in their teams. They need to provide data for a diverse set of needs, operational or analytical, without a clear understanding of the application of the data and access to the consuming domain's experts.

In a mature and ideal situation, an operational system and it's team or organizational unit, are not only responsible for providing business capabilities but also responsible for providing the _truths of their business domain_ as source domain datasets. At enterprise scale there is never a one to one mapping between a domain concept and a source system. There are often many systems that can serve parts of the data that belongs to a domain, some legacy and some easy to change. Hence there might be many _source aligned datasets_ aka _reality datasets_ that ultimately need to be aggregated to a cohesive domain aligned dataset.

Service-based approaches may have been around for a while, but they still offer relatively little insight into how to share significant datasets between services.

The underlying issue is that data and services donâ€™t sing too sweetly together. On one side, encapsulation encourages us to hide data; decoupling services from one another so they can continue to change and grow. This is about planning for the future. But on the other side, we need the freedom to slice and dice shared data like any other dataset. This is about getting on with our job right now, with the same freedoms as any other data system.

But data systems have little to do with encapsulation. In fact, quite the contrary. Databases do everything they can to expose the data they hold. They come with a wonderfully powerful, declarative interface that can contort data into pretty much any shape you might desire. Exactly what you need for exploratory investigation, but not so great for managing the onset of complexity in a burgeoning service estate.
